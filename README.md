## Summary

Senior data scientist with 10+ years experience in health care focused on clinical data. My involvement usually begins with discussing a leader's vision and converting this to an actionable specification and development plan. I may need to work across departments creating new data sources. Then I select an appropriate algorithm and we can start building a solution. I frequently lead teams of 2-5 people. Results are frequently distributed to hundreds of employees including VP for the Pacific Northwest division and a hospital president.

## Experience

### Senior Clinical Data Scientist, Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, December 2011 to Present

#### Current Long-Term Projects
* Statistical forecaster for COVID hospitalizations (March 2020 to present)
  - I design, create, and maintain a stochastic model forecasting hospital bed usage at Virginia Mason hospital (both ICU and acute-care). Reports updated automatically each day.
  - Results used by C-level executives, members of statewide task force, staffing specialists, surgery leadership, and many others.
  - Model leverages official state and county statistics, statewide projections, and our internal statistics.
  - Wrote several white papers on analytic methods and comparison with county, state and federal statistics.

* Senior consultant for cancer outcomes suite (August 2022 to present). Working directly with Divisional VP and VMMC President to manage expectatoins and create both specifications and development plans. Work across multiple departments to identify, create, and validate data sources. Identify technical challenges and coordinate their resolution. Create both queries and final reporting tools. Current challenges include
  - Some data sources are not current
  - Merging data sources from different vendors running on incompatible networks

* Technical co-lead on data integration team (June 2022 to present). Tasked with advising leadership on integrating two disparate teams providing different services based on different computer systems and archtectures.

* Technical lead and senior developer for a summary dashboard of 15 health outcomes metrics (January 2022 to present)
  - Leading a team of 3 developers to provide monthly status reports on 13 health outcomes metrics and two summary metrics.
  - Results provided to providers, clinic managers, hospital leadership, division leadership.
  - Converted HEDIS specifications to actionable data requirements.
  - Database design for both summary data and patient-specific audit trail.
  - Created a new metric measuring the impact of patient improvement on the overall metrics. Results approved by division manager.
  - Personally responsible for 6 clinical measures, both summary metrics, and the overall report.
  - "Apples vs oranges" comparison between this project and the next.

* Senior data scientist on chronic conditions data mart tracking multiple conditions for the department of primary care. (March 2016 to present)
  - This is a very complex project and leverages a single custom-built data mart with reports for primary care providers, patient outreach, claims processing, and senior management. Results presented at Symposium on Data Science and Statistics.
  - Assist the lead physicians turn health management flow charts into actionable metrics and dashboards. This includes custom-built metrics for the current state of care, alerting on best practices, and tracking performance.

* Senior developer for annual Medicare clinical audit (January 2017 to present). Responsible for all automatic data extraction and upload for this annual audit affecting the contract with our largest payer. Over 6 years, progressive development reduced the required labor from 2 deveopers and 3 nurse abstractors for 3.5 months to 1 developer and 2 abstractors for under 2 months.

#### Selected Past Projects
* Project lead on text-analysis project mining clinical notes for submission to a statewide database (SCOAP - Surgical Care and Outcomes Assessment Program)
  - Worked with the client to understand their needs, prioritize goals, and manage expectations.
  - Provided extensive advice on all parts of software development including specifications, data selection, algorithm selection, and performance measurement.
  - Results: 
    * First priority data can be extreacted with a high level of fidelity. 
    * The client reviewed the confusion matrix and determined a certain level of manual chart review would still be necessary.
    * Subsequent review indicated this can only be resolved with a larger training set (not currently available).

* Lead data scientist on predicting ICU staffing requirements (two related requests):
  - Urgent case model (e.g., cardiac arrest) uses a simple date-based model.
  - Emergent usage (e.g., planned elective surgery) is modeled using a deep neural network.
  - Results:
    * Improvements to the urgent case model will be minor at best and require a very large effort due to the high variability inherent in the data.
    * Emergent model was developed but we could not measure performance on real data due to COVID pandemic.

* Lead data scientist on producing forward-looking models for retrospective performance metrics pertaining to cancer patients. The metrics focus on the time up to death and we seek to improve care without knowing the death date in advance.

* Statistician for several peer-reviewed [publications](README.md#publications).

* Led a LEAN workshop on living donor kidney transplants. Improved nominal capacity from 12 per year to 21 per year.

* Designed and developed an automated tool for tracking multiple metrics related to patient phone calls. Project mined the back-end database, summarized the results, and daily emailed the summaries to appropriate managers.
  - Initially created for one department, the tool was adopted by over a dozen cost centers.

* Created a clinic tool to capture all pertinent data for prostate biopsies and create (a) the nurse's clinic note, (b) the doctor's clinic note, and (c) the research record. This tool eliminated much re-work and significantly increased both speed and accuracy of the entered data.

* Research data manager for Urology and Renal Transplant.
  - Managed all research databases (about a dozen separate projects) using a common tool (REDCap)
    * user permissions, data security, HIPAA compliance
    * database design and porting
    * interface design
    * real-time data quality checks
    * pre-populating projects with data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR - Cerner-based)
    * data extraction, summary, and analysis
